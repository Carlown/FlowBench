# Changelog

## [1.2.4] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- Added a public MQTT relay mode for Server Agents. Relay node bundles no longer require users to enter a public server IP or domain, and servers only need outbound internet access instead of an open inbound TCP 8787 control port.
- Added automatic relay URL and controller-token generation and persistence so newly generated nodes can be controlled immediately and additional nodes can join the same private relay channel.

### Changed

- Unified the desktop app, updater, installer, documentation, and release metadata on version 1.2.4.
- Made installer migration prompts follow the selected setup language instead of mixing Chinese and English.
- Refined the application layout with more consistent page margins, card spacing, top alignment, navigation reflow, and responsive two-column-to-stacked breakpoints across the primary views.
- Improved the Server Agents and Collaborative Testing pages so controls remain usable and visually balanced at both wide and narrow window sizes.

### Fixed

- Preserved the configured accent color when switching between light and dark themes.
- Cancelled locally queued stress tests when Stop is pressed during the short startup-render delay.
- Cancelled queued collaborative remote starts when a stop command arrives, including starts waiting for a previous job to finish.
- Restored the previous report, or the empty report state, when a test fails or is cancelled before startup.
- Prevented importing an already-installed folder plugin from deleting its own source directory.
- Recognized plugin files with uppercase or mixed-case `.py` extensions.

### Verified

- Added regression coverage for theme accent persistence, queued-start cancellation, version consistency, and English UI text.
- Passed all 29 automated tests, packaged-application startup smoke testing, and the Inno Setup 7 installer build.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- Added a cross-platform headless server-agent mode with an authenticated control Hub, outbound-only polling, heartbeat reporting, and persistent command cursors.
- Added a “Server Agents” page to the desktop GUI for refreshing agents, starting and stopping authorized jobs, and viewing live node status and operation logs.
- Added one-click server-node bundle generation for Windows and Linux, including Hub and Agent credentials, generated HTTPS certificates, startup scripts, and bounded configuration.
- Added server-node status tiles for total requests, successes, live QPS, and total traffic, with per-node state and traffic details.
- Added agent job progress reporting and completion summaries, including total packets, successes, failures, latency, and sent bytes.
- Added Docker deployment files and Railway guidance for Hub/Agent bundles.
- Added English release notes and updated bilingual documentation in `SERVER_AGENT.md`.

### Changed

- Kept the Stress Test page focused on local jobs; server jobs now display their live status on the Server Agents page.
- Preserved the Collaborative Testing node-status card and added total sent traffic.
- Improved dark-mode consistency for dialogs, status editors, theme-color swatches, and hover backgrounds.
- Unified application, installer, updater, and release metadata to version 1.2.2.

### Fixed

- Fixed a packaged-application startup failure where the first PySide6.QtCore import could fail with a missing DLL entry point; bundled PySide6/shiboken6 DLL directories are now registered and Shiboken/QtCore are preloaded in frozen builds.
- Excluded incompatible bundled ICU DLLs so Qt uses the Windows-provided ICU runtime instead of a conflicting ICU 78 runtime.
- Removed automatic marketplace PR merging; external submissions now remain open for manual maintainer review.
- Kept the legacy marketplace workflow filename as a no-op guard so older clients cannot re-enable automatic merging.
- Fixed server-node completion logs repeating after polling resumed; completion entries are now deduplicated per node and job.
- Fixed startup races in all-in-one Linux bundles by waiting for the Hub `/health` endpoint before starting the Agent.
- Fixed self-signed control-plane TLS handling with a GUI compatibility retry when the generated CA file is unavailable; controller tokens are still required.
- Fixed Hub handling of aborted TLS handshakes and HTTP clients pointing at HTTPS ports, preventing noisy disconnect errors.
- Fixed Hub and Agent binding/URL mismatch in generated bundles when a non-default public port was specified.
- Fixed dark-mode dialog fallback and a potential settings-card color import issue.
- Prevented page controls from remaining transparent after rapid page switches or missed animation callbacks.

### Verified

- Agent/Hub unit tests passed: 6/6.
- Python compilation and AST checks passed.
- Light/dark UI smoke tests passed across all primary pages and dialogs.
- Windows Agent, Hub, CLI, desktop GUI, and Inno Setup installer builds completed.
